# background
I was trying to apply a XSL transformation to a whole folder. I also tried to add tags in tags that already exist - I took for example too add a ```<change>``` in the ```<revisionDesc>``` to each file of the folder.

# things I used
Test files are old XML files I found on my computer. I created 1.xml, 2.xml and 3.xml for test purposes.

# issues
Huge namespace issue - needs to be solve so as to work.
